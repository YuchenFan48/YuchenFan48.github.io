# About me

Hi there! I am a 4th-year undergraduate student at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT). I was previously a research assistant at the Knowledge Engineering Group at Tsinghua University, supervised by Prof. [Juanzi Li](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1303/4318.htm). I was also a visting student at Westlake University, supervised by Prof. [Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io/). I work closely with Dr. [Ning Ding](https://www.stingning.cn/), Dr. [Ganqu Cui](https://cgq15.github.io/) and Prof. [Bowen Zhou](http://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/zhoubowen/zh_CN/index.htm).

I am going to pursue a Ph.D. in School of Artificial Intelligence at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) and Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in 2025 under the supervision of Prof. [Zhouhan Lin](https://hantek.github.io/) and Prof. [Bowen Zhou](http://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/zhoubowen/zh_CN/index.htm).

Currently, my interest lies in LLM alignment, and reward model. If you are interested in these topics, feel free to reach out to me!
